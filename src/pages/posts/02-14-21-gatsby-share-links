# Gatsby Share Links



You may or may not have seen [Responsible Share Links](https://jonsuh.com/blog/social-share-links/). 
From the article:

> Social share scripts are convenient and easy to copy & paste but rely on JavaScript and add additional overhead to your site, which > means more HTTP requests and slower load times. Instead, use share links that donâ€™t require you to load scripts for each social site.

Sounds good to me! I'm a big fan of implementing simple components myself anyway, rather than loading a million libraries. So I wrote a React component to add share links to the upcoming website overhaul of Spacepost.io.

```
  const [popup, setPopup] = useState({
    url: ""
  })

  function windowPopup(e) {
    let screenSize = getWindowDimensions();
    var width = screenSize.width/2;
    var height = screenSize.height/2;
      e.preventDefault();
      console.log(e.currentTarget.getAttribute('href'))
      var url = e.currentTarget.getAttribute('href')
      setPopup(url)
    
      var left = (screenSize.width / 2) - (width / 2),
        top = (screenSize.height / 2) - (height / 2);  
      window.open(
        url,
        "",
        "menubar=no,toolbar=no,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes,width=" + width + ",height=" + height + ",top=" + top + ",left=" + left
      );
  }

  function getWindowDimensions() {
    const { innerWidth: width, innerHeight: height } = window;
    return {
      width,
      height
    };
  }

```
