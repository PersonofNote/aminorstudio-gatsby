This is a series of articles covering fastai's machine learning course.

Why am I doing this?

I'm simultaneously excited and terrified about the direction we're going with AI.

Tl;dr: I want to teach robots to love. But first, I have to teach them to recognize cats.

So, right into it. I decided to use Google Cloud Platform because that's the platform with which I have the most experience. (I've set up a few Jupyterhubs/Kubernetes clusters for data scientists in my day.) As is classic with GCP, I immediately ran into hiccups with the directions, but nothing too difficult. A couple potential gotchas:

- For increasing the GPU quota, the filters look far different than they do in the instructions. That's ok; just click through the pages of quotas and search in page.

- When copy-pasting the instance creation code, don't forget to remove the trailing slashes first, or you'll get an error. Possibly an obvious thing, but if you're not already a coder you might get thrown off by the error.
