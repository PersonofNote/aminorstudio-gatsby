*I'm working on a macro-tracking/nutrition tracking app because I quite frankly hate all the ones that exist. I don't like the emphasis on weight, I don't like the calorie-cutting defaults, I don't like the UIs. I hate them so much. So, I'm designing and building my own in the hopes that I will actually use it. In the process, I'm writing up posts about it to outline the process and hopefully help demystify some things!*

Now that I've got a basic design and roadmap sketched out and we've made a really basic front end, it's time to set up the API. For this project I've chosen to use Express just to keep in all in Javascript. If you're a little bit more familiar with the process, you could easily substitute another framework like Flask, Django, Laravel to write in whatever language you like.
