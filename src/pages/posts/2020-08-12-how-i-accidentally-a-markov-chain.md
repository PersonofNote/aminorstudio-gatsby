*Note: This post is about a game demo I originally made in November 2017. I made a series of small games exploring interesting (to me) concepts, and am reproducing my old devlogs/doing retrospective writeups here.*

*This particular game turned out to be too ambitious for my project-management skills/code organization at the time, but I enjoy the concept and design, and think the AI code is also somewhat interesting. This post is about building the AI*
