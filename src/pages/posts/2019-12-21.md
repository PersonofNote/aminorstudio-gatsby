Some years ago, I signed up for League of Legends. I planned for my handle to be "A Person of Little Consequence" so that the message "You have slain/been slain by a person of little consequence" would appear on everyone's screens. But, character limits exist, so I switched to A Person of Note. Same energy, less self-deprecating. As a happy accident, it's also a nod to my background as a classical musician, and one of my first LoL mains (Sona, naturally).

A Minor Studio evolved pretty naturally out of that. I'm just one person, and I make things. My 'studio' is wherever I am, and encompasses the space around me and my laptop. Plus it's another music pun. I know. So cool.
