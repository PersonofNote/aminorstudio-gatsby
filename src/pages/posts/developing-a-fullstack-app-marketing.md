*I'm working on a macro-tracking/nutrition tracking app because I quite frankly hate all the ones that exist. I don't like the emphasis on weight, I don't like the calorie-cutting defaults, I don't like the UIs. I hate them so much. So, I'm designing and building my own in the hopes that I will actually use it. In the process, I'm writing up posts about it to outline the process and hopefully help demystify some things!*

This is probably my weakest subject, but I learned a lot in this process, and I hope you will, too!

First up, I looked for similar projects. If you've thought of an app idea, someone has probably done it. I talk about this a bit in the design phase, because this part you should definitely do before you start building. Take notes. Install several of them if you can, and compare what you like and don't like about each one. What hard edges can you sand away? What cool twist can you add?

Next up is user testing. This app is small and not really designed to be a huge commercial success, but I did want to go through the motions and get some practice doing the full-on entreprenerial thing, so I decided to get some users. Instead of paying a focus group, I went to r/xxfitness, because they are the audience I'm going after, and asked them for feedback on the name, the app, etc.
