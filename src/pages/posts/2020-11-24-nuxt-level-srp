My last post was about math, and then I stopped posting! It's not because I got scared off by the math, but because I got called back in to the office and the commute means I have about 2.5 fewer hours in my day. I do plan to get back to exploring machine learning, but in the meantime I wanted to talk about Nuxt.js, a Vue framework that does static site deployment.
