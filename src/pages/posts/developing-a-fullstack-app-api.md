*I'm working on a macro-tracking/nutrition tracking app because I quite frankly hate all the ones that exist. I don't like the emphasis on weight, I don't like the calorie-cutting defaults, I don't like the UIs. I hate them so much. So, I'm designing and building my own in the hopes that I will actually use it. In the process, I'm writing up posts about it to outline the process and hopefully help demystify some things!*

*I'm going to be talking about the tech used in general as well as specific terms, and focusing less on copypasta code and more on concepts. I figure it'll be more useful that way; after all, you're probably not trying to build a macro-tracking app. Or if you are, it's hopefully not going to look like *my* macro tracking app, what's the point of that?*

If you haven't already, set up a folder to keep your whole project in, and then inside that, set up one to keep your backend in. I call mine backend, but I've seen api and other options.
