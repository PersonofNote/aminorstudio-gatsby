## My credentials

I am not a personal trainer, but I am generally considered to be a pretty fit person, who enjoys a lot of skill-based activities. I invented this method to learn headstands with in my early 20s, and then failed to handstand for about a decade trying to learn handstands the "right" ways. Finally got a solid handstand in 2020 by trusting my own methods and experience, and am writing about it in case it clicks for anyone else.

## Another Handstand Post?

Yes. I haven't seen this approach mentioned anywhere, and it may not work for everyone, but it did for me.

## The Process

I am strong enough and flexible enough to do a handstand. I've tried all the drills over the past 10 years. Some of it is not putting in the time, but my handstanding friends were all bewildered. My form is fine, everything looks good, so what gives?

I ended up essentially reverse engineering handstands from the top down. This does run counter to the common widsom that you should focus more on freestanding and chest-to-wall handstands than back-to-wall handstands. But I decided to focus exclusively on back-to-wall handstands a little bit away from the wall, and focus exclusively on the end position of balancing, and increasing my time spent upside-down that way. Then, once I could kick up into a handstand, slowly tap the wall and then maintain a solid hold a little bit away from the wall, I focused on exiting as slowly as possible.
