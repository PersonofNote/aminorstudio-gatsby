I was the lead developer on the ground-up overhaul of the existing [ifti.edu](https://ifti.edu/) site, built from static mockups. It includes my first production use of both Vue and CSS Grid. Additionally, the site gave me a lot of practice with carousels and integrating third-party plugins.



The site overhaul features:

- Several new post types
- A modernized, grid-based news page
- Customizable sliders
- An events system
- Box-breaking callout designs

And was built with: 
- PHP
- Wordpress RESTful API
- LESS, following the [BEM](http://getbem.com/naming/) naming convention 
- Some Vue components
- jQuery
- Webpack/Babel
