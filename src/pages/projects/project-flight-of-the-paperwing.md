Flight of the PaperWing was my first completed game. I wrote it in Game Maker Language, a C-like language designed for the Game Maker engine. I wanted to make something a little bit different from a regular infinite runner, but also wanted to make sure that I could actually finish the project.

The player moves using the phone's accelerometer. I wrote custom easing functions to get the dive and swoop that I wanted; for example, the dive is a very steep-sloped variation of an ease-in function.

Obstacles are procedurally generated, and difficulty is controlled along a sinewave that increases in slope and amplitude over time, giving the player a rhythm and a pleasing series of difficulty versus breathing room.

I designed and created all of the assets, mechanics and code for this project.

Ultimately, the non-standard movement controls are a bit of a gimmick, but they did achieve the feeling of piloting a paper plane.

Flight of the Paperwing is avaiable for download on the Google Play Store.
