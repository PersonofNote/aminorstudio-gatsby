This project was two branded sweepstakes games in association with Showtime, Comcast Xfinity, and other clients. The games are full-stack Laravel apps where a user clicks on the appropriate location on the map according to provided hints in order to enter a sweepstakes. I mostly did front end on this project; some of the infrastructre was carried over from other projects, and the only backend work I did involved hooking up a couple of new routes.


I have grouped these two games together because they are essentially the same game, but there were a few interesting differences in ending presentation and logic, such as one game having an extra reward screen and the other having two endings.
