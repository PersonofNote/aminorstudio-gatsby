This project was two branded sweepstakes games in association with Showtime, Comcast Xfinity, and other clients. The games are full-stack Laravel apps with Blade templating, where a user clicks on the appropriate location on the map according to provided hints in order to enter a sweepstakes. The user data is collected in a MySql database. A correct location is rewarded with a gif from the show and the next piece of the story; an incorrect guess elicits increasingly clear but snarky hints.


I have grouped these two games together because they are essentially the same game, but there were a few interesting differences in ending presentation and logic, such as one game having an extra reward screen and the other having two endings.


These Showtime activities feature:

- An emphasis on user engagement
- Data collection for sweepstakes


And were built with: 
- PHP and Laravel
- jQuery
- Bootstrap
- MySQL
