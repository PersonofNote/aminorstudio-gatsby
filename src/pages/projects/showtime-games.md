![Billions map](billions-map.png)


This project was two branded sweepstakes games in association with Showtime, Comcast Xfinity, and other clients. The games are full-stack Laravel apps where a user clicks on the appropriate location on the map to advance the story. A correct selection is rewarded with a gif from the show and the next part of the story. An incorrect selection is met with increasingly snarky hints. Upon the successful completion of the activity, the user can join a sweepstakes. User data is collected in a mySql database.


I have grouped these two games together because they are essentially the same game, but there were a few interesting differences in ending presentation and logic, such as one game having an extra reward screen and the other having two endings.
