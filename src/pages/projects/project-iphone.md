From August 8-September 10, 2019, I worked onsite in Cupertino in preparation for the Iphone-11 launch. I worked on a team of developers, designers, and QA testers to contribute to Apple's website for the launch.
     
I can't say a lot about this project, as much of it is under NDA, but it was a wonderful experience that allowed me to see inside one of the world's most successful tech companies, and work within that context.
