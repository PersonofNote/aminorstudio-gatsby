I am a founding member of the Brightmoments DAO, and built the first iteration of [Brightmoments.io](https://brightmoments.io/) for the popup gallery. I worked from Figma wireframes and built the website and the api that synchs among the website and three screens displaying featured NFTs in the physical gallery.

[Read about the popup on Decrypt](https://decrypt.co/68536/bright-moments-nft-art-installation-is-bringing-the-venice-ca-counter-culture-into-web-3-0) and check out the [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/brightmomentsgallery/)


The project is still under active development and will be changing significantly over the next year.

For this project I:
- Designed and implemented the database
- Designed and wrote the api
- Built three versions of the frontend
- Synchronized the site's live gallery display and the screens using a mock scheduler

Short-term planned improvements:
- Solidifying the Venice flagship template to allow low-friction spinup of additional locations
- Replacing the current scheduler with a more robust pub-sub pattern
- Completing live updates with webhook architecture
- Onboarding team to maintain and implement future components
- Migrating from Heroku/Netlify to a more robust cloud provider

Long-term plans:
- Implement Zoro auction house
- Redesign api to use Notion as CMS and database per DAO group decision
