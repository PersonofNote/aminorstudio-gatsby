One of my first React projects was designed to consume a free news API and display articles side-by-side from different sources, to display the starkly different treatment of the same topics in news. I have kept this project for display purposes, but I found that this created a false equivalency in journalism, as for some reason far-right news sources have much more easily accessible APIs than far left. I may revisit this project in the future.
