I couldn't find a good-looking, easy-to-use, not-weight-obsessed macro tracker, so I built one that I wanted to use. The number on the scale is just one point in a whole picture of health, but as a society we (especially women) seem to still have the conditioning to be obsessed with that number. But I find that I perform and feel the best when I am taking more holistic approach.

The app is currently in the 1.0 stage. The next feature will be the ability to store foods and quickly select them with an autofill. I also plan to add jwt authentication if anyone else expresses interest in using the app.
