STARZ wanted to drive engagement and consumer awareness for the shows Power Book II: Ghost and American Gods (upcoming). To that end, I built a fun personality quiz, where users answer questions to determine a personality match with a character from the show.


These Starz activities feature:

- An emphasis on user engagement


And were built with: 
- Vue (Nuxt)
