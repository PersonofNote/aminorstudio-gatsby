In 2017 I co-founded Spacepost, an art/tech collective and hackerspace, with Stanley Bishop. We started off doing virtual reality in an easy-up on the Venice Beach boardwalk before moving into the WNDO space, owned by longtime resident and artist Jim Budman. 

Through 2018 I developed branding, did web development and assisted in hobby data science projects, and helped build out the space and run locally-focused events, including:

- The ideation meeting for [Queens of the Stoned Age](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7160388/)
- Episode premiere parties for [Queens of the Stoned Age](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7160388/)
- Local music video premieres
- A mixed-reality art exhibit as part of the 2018 [Venice Art Crawl](http://www.veniceartcrawl.com/)
- [Matterport](https://matterport.com/) 3D-imaging of various spaces and art collections


I remain involved in the space in an unofficial capacity. Mostly notably, in 2019 I assisted in giving a talk about data visualization in Python using Jupyter notebooks, and in 2020-21 I am working on an overhaul of spacepost.io

The space continues to be a thriving space for STE(A)M advocacy and support, as well as holding events to support the local Venice Beach community.
