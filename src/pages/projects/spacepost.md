In 2017 I helped found Spacepost, an art/tech collective and hackerspace, with Stanley Bishop. We started off doing virtual reality in an easy-up on the Venice Beach boardwalk before moving into the WNDO space, owned by longtime resident and artist Jim Budman. Through 2018 I developed branding and helped build out the space and run locally-focused events, including: 
*  Hosting the premieres of 
    * [Queens of the Stoned Age](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7160388/)
    *

In 2019 I returned briefly to assist with giving a talk about data visualization in Python using Jupyter notebooks.
