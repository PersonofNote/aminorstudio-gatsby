In 2018, I showed at the annual Venice Art Crawl at The Wndow warehouse in Venice Beach. I created several augmented-reality pixel-art pieces for an exhibit about the intersection of art and tech. Spectators downloaded the [Artivive App](https://artivive.com/) and used their phones to view an animated version of the image on the wall.
