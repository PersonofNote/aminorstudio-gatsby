    In 2018, I showed at the annual Venice Art Crawl at The Wndow warehouse in Venice Beach. I created several augmented-reality pixel-art pieces for an exhibit about the intersection of art and tech. Spectators downloaded an app and used their phones to view an animated version of the image on the wall.
